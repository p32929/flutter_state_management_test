# flutter_state_management_test

While I was trying Flutter, I knew that Flutter is inspired by `React`. So, I wanted to know all the ways I can manage the `states`.
This repository is just an example project of how states are managed in Flutter by different State management libraries.

I tried Redux in both Flutter and ReactJS but I didn't really like the way Redux is implemented in Flutter(That's just my opinion).
So, I tried some state management libs in this repo. So far, I liked the `states_rebuilder` library. You may try it from here:
